# MoviePopv2.3
My project for Mentor Carlos.
Hi Carlos. I pulled the API key out of the files before the commit. Like I said in the chat pod it was working for a while, Details page has a 
checkbox for favorites and that would make then the selected ones would appear on the favorites view which could be selected by
the favorites option in the menu. Then after adding a layout for tablets it all stopped and when the displayActivity starts and checks
if the movie that it came in with the bundle from amin activity is already in the database it crashes and says that column doesn't exist.
Its odd because it was working just fine and I didn't change anything about the table or the contract. Thanks so much for your help.
